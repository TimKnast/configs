 - fifoc receiver sender:
   Opens the fifo ~/.irssi/receiver:sender for
   reading and sender:receiver for writing.
   Intended for use with named pipes (fifos).
   To enable chat between two users the pipes
   must be accesdible by both users.
   You can use symlinks to a pair of pipes in a
   shared directory like /tmp, or you can use
   hardlinks (recommended for security reasons)
   e.g:
     mkfifo /tmp/{$a:$b,$b:$a}
     # both users execute:
     link {/tmp,~/.irssi}/$a:$b
     link {/tmp,~/.irssi}/$b:$a
     # pray no one evil did the same
     rm /tmp/{$a:$b,$b:$a}
   in irssi:
     /fifoc friend mynick

   Note: Output will be printed to main window
   if a chat window is closed.
   To reopen window: /refifoc friend mynick
   To kill a conversation: /hup friend:mynick
